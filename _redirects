# Cloudflare Pages Redirects Configuration

# Redirect /home to root
/home / 301

# Handle common URL patterns
/index /

# Force HTTPS (this is handled by Cloudflare by default, but included for clarity)
# All HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS by Cloudflare Pages

# Fallback for 404 - serve index.html (useful if you add client-side routing later)
# Note: Currently this is a single-page static site, so most 404s should show actual 404
# Uncomment the line below if you add client-side routing:
# /* /index.html 200
